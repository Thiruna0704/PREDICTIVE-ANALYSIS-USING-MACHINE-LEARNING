🚗 Vehicle Selling Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predictive analysis using Machine Learning to estimate the selling price of used vehicles based on historical data.
The model analyzes various features such as vehicle age, kilometers driven, ownership details, and showroom price to predict an accurate selling price.

This project was completed as part of CODTECH Internship – Task 2.

🎯 Objective

Build a Machine Learning model to predict vehicle selling prices

Perform data preprocessing and feature selection

Train and evaluate the model using regression techniques

Visualize prediction performance

🗂 Dataset Description
